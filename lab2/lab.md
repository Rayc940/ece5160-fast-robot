## Sample Data

Next, I ran Example1_MicrophoneOutput from File → Examples → PDM.
A YouTube Video of C major scale audio was played, and serial monitor showed changing detected frequency content.

## Discussion

This lab provides experience with programming the Artemis board and communicating with computer wirelessly using BLE. I practiced sending commands from the computer to the Artemis and receiving data back, which helped us understand how BLE characteristics and notifications work. I also learned the difference between sending data in real time vs. storing data in an array and sending it all at once.

There was no significant challenge encountered during this lab. Overall, this lab helped build a strong understanding of BLE communication and data handling, which will be important for future labs.
